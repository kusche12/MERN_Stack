### Things that I learned from this project:
Frontend:
1. React hooks for functional components (useState, useEffect)
2. Redux for app-wide state control
3. Client-Side Routing for Single Page Applications

Backend:
1. Generating strict schema for ensuring clean data
2. Using express to define website routing
3. CRUD operations with a MongoDB server


### Udemy
This project was made alongside the Udemy course [MERN Stack Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/) by Brad Traversy (github: [bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) )
I highly recommend this course to anyone at an intermediate skill-level with React and Redux and are interested in learning more about backend technologies.


### Conclusion
This project was a huge help in connecting the dots between frontend and backend services. Although my passion still lies in frontend web development, I hope to continue gaining more knowledge on backend services to support my web apps. The MERN stack is an incredible tool for rapid production, and it makes it incredibly easy for the developer to make changes to the schema at any given moment during development.
